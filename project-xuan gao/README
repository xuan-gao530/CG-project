 Some problems
 1) When I use "errcheck" in display function , it has error "1282 invalid operation". But I don't find the reason. I will work on it.
 2) It seems like that the shader is weird. I will spend time to deal with it.

 Something that remains to be done
 1） Now I just have a simple light and I need to deal with mulptiple light using shader.
 2)  I will try to draw a simple fireworks which is my stretch goal.
